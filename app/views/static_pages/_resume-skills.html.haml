%h3 Design skills
.alert
  I love user interface design and the unique blend of creativity and logical thought that go into it. While design has not been my main role for quite some time, I have been a part of interface design projects and am hoping to expand on this in future projects.
%ul
  %li User Interface design and iteration based on client feedback. 
  %li Pixel perfect attention to detail, and really strive for design simplicity.
  %li Strong understanding of usability, information architecture, and design principles.
  %li Experience with A/B testing and other site optimization techniques
  %li Graphic design experience including branding and print production.
  %li Strong photography skills, both technically and conceptually. Yeah, I know everyone thinks they are a photographer, but I actually worked as a photographers assistant for a year and was able to gain some professional insight. Plus I love taking photos.
