      %small Lead Javascript Developer - San Francisco, CA - May 2012 - Present
    %p
      Currently I am leading a team of six front-end developers on a thick client side web application.
      This consists of setting up application architecture, performing code reviews of other team members work, and
      helping troubleshoot problems. The project uses an in-house javascript framework for structure.

      %small Javascript Developer - San Francisco, CA - July 2012 - March 2013
    %p
      RGA is a large digital advertising agency where I worked as a contractor, primarily doing javascript development.
      During that time I worked on various client projects for Microsoft and Nike. These projects ranged from Facebook
      applications to interactive websites to mobile web apps, all using different technology stacks due to client specific needs.
      Projects usually used
      %a{:href => "http://backbonejs.org/", :target => "_blank"} Backbone
      for code structure. All projects were localized for foreign markets, and had extensive QA testing (device testing, load balancing, etc.).

        was previously

        After a pivot in business focus, Halogen re-branded itself as Social Chorus. I have them listed as two separate jobs because my role as a developer changed drastically after the transition. Career-wise I was with the same company for two years.

      Social Chorus offers advocate marketing solutions. As a developer, I was in charge of building their influencer relationship management platform. Thanks to an engagement with

        %a{:href => "http://pivotallabs.com/", :target => "_blank"} Pivotal Labs
      our team instilled strict agile practices including paired programming and test driven development. The technology stack was Rails 3.2, unit testing with Rspec, Jasmine, and Selenium.
      Continuous integration tests with Jenkins. I was with the product from inception to it's beta release
      and learned an incredible amount about the Ruby language and application architecture.
      With regards to design, I helped shape the user interface by meeting daily with the design team to discuss potential issues and offer alternative solutions.

      %small Lead Front End Developer - San Francisco, CA - March 2010 - August 2011
    %p
      Before Social Chorus' pivot, the company was known as Halogen and  was an advertising agency and network that worked mainly with "affluent brands". All agency development was done in house. All applications were put into rails projects, version controlled, code reviewed and refactored. I was given a wide array of work, from creating Facebook applications, custom content management systems, wire-framing and design work, embeddable rich media ad units, and high traffic websites. As the "front-end guy", I faced many unique challenges, including dabbling with html5 technologies and wrangling legacy browsers (including IE6) into pixel perfect websites. I also trained several employees and advised management on technology direction.

      Did a wide range of work for the university on their website including cleaning up and refactoring legacy code, training employees on how to use the content management system, and helping transition data from their old cms to the newly developed one. I also built a custom CMS for one of their departments,

        %a{:href => "http://globalorthopaedics.org/", :target => "_blank"} The Institute for Global Orthopaedics & Traumatology
      The department was dissatisfied with the status of their website: information was hard to find, load times were slow, the content management system was useless, and the website was not cross browser compatible. Working with their administrators, I did a complete overhaul of the information architecture and built a website with simple content management capabilities that was so well received that the
      %a{:href => "http://orthosurg.ucsf.edu/patient-care/mission-bay.html", :target => "_blank"} entire department
      used it as development model during their platform update.

    %p
      Worked several long term contract jobs with music industry specialist Oniracom. Oniracom is a marketing agency that deals mostly with well-known musicians and Hollywood celebrities. I worked in their online division and primarily worked as a front-end developer, building many of their websites. The company used
      %a{:href => "http://expressionengine.com/", :target => "_blank"} Expression Engine
      for content management, and I did have to do some PHP work to tie the front-end to the cms. I also did website design work for the agency.
