I have them listed as two separate jobs because my role as a developer changed drastically after the transition, but career-wise I was with the same company for two years.

                    our team instilled strict agile practices including daily stand-ups, paired programming, and test driven development for every piece of functionality. The technology stack was Rails 3.2 with deployment on Heroku, unit tested with Rspec, Jasmine, and Selenium. The application ran continuous integration tests with Jenkins on an EC2 instance that fired a new build every time there was a push to our Github repo. I was with the product from inception to it's beta release and learned an incredible amount about the Ruby language and application architecture. With regards to design, I helped shape the user interface by meeting daily with the design team to discuss potential issues and offered alternative solutions.

                    and  was an advertising agency and network that worked mainly with "affluent" brands. All agency development was done in house. All applications were put into rails projects, version controlled, code reviewed and refactored. I was given a wide array of work, from creating Facebook applications, custom content management systems, wire-framing and design work, embeddable rich media ad units, and high traffic websites. As the "front-end guy", I faced many unique challenges, including dabbling with html5 technologies and wrangling legacy browsers (including IE6) into becoming pixel perfect. I also trained several employees and advised management on technology direction.

                    Did a wide range of work for the university on their website including cleaning up and refactoring legacy code, training employees on how to use the content management system, and helping transition data from their old cms to the newly developed one.

                    The department was dissatisfied with the status of their website: information was hard to find, load times were slow, the content management system was useless, and the website was not cross browser compatible. Working with their administrators, I did a complete overhaul of the information architecture and built a website with simple content management capabilities that was so well received that the
